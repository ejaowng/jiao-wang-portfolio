## File Sizes and What to Expect

- **Total project size**: ~200-300 MB (includes node_modules)
- **Source code only**: ~2-3 MB
- **Built site (dist/)**: ~500 KB - 1 MB

---

## Important Notes

### Resume File
Your resume PDF is located at:
```
client/public/JiaoResume-v4.docx
```

You can replace this with your own resume file. Just ensure it's in the same location.

### Image Assets
Your generated images are in:
```
client/public/images/
```

These include:
- `hero-background.png` - Homepage hero section
- `ai-telecom-visualization.png` - Projects section
- `agentic-ai-concept.png` - Featured project
- And other visual assets

### Environment Variables
The project uses environment variables for analytics and other services. These are automatically injected by Manus. When deploying to GitHub Pages, you don't need to configure these manually.

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find the Download button"
1. Make sure you're in the **Code** tab of the Management UI
2. Look for a button labeled "Download all files" or similar
3. If not visible, try refreshing the page

### "The ZIP file is too large"
- The file includes `node_modules/` which can be large
- You can delete `node_modules/` after downloading (it's generated by `pnpm install`)
- This reduces the file size to ~5-10 MB

### "I want to edit files but don't know where to start"
- All page content is in `client/src/pages/`
- Styles are in `client/src/index.css`
- Components are in `client/src/components/`
- See `README.md` for development guidelines
